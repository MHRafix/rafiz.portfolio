	Reservetable is a comprehensive restaurant reservation system designed to
	simplify the process of managing reservation requests for restaurant owners.
	The system offers a user-friendly dashboard that allows restaurant owners to
	efficiently handle reservation requests and streamline their table booking
	process. Additionally, the application features the capability for restaurant
	owners to generate custom reservation forms, similar to Google Forms,
	facilitating the collection of table booking reservations. The system's
	pricing structure is tailored to different feature sets, providing flexibility
	to restaurant owners. A super admin dashboard offers a centralized hub for
	Reservetable stakeholders to monitor subscriptions, orders, support
	interactions, and overall analytics.
